        <h1>About</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>
          Hi, my name is Tino Selić (he/him). I am a versatile digital artist and designer whose work spans a wide range
          of media—from 3D modelling and animation to websites, games, and interactive experiences.
        </h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Interactive Media from Augsburg University of Applied Sciences
          in
          2021. Currently, I am studying New Media
          (Master of Arts) with a minor in Game Design and Development at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland.
          <br>
          <br>
          In spring 2019, I participated in the Erasmus+ programme and spent a semester abroad at the University of
          Lapland in Rovaniemi, Finland. During this time, I experienced the beauty of Finland's natural phenomena—the
          northern lights, the polar night, and the midnight sun. Since then, these extraordinary scenarios have been a
          great source of inspiration for my artistic work. Conceptually, I like to explore
          themes from nature, technology, and human emotions, often weaving narratives from fiction, personal
          experiences, and cultural exchange.
          <br>
          <br>
          I speak German, English, and a bit of Finnish.
        </p>
